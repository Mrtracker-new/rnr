BAR treats it like a secret.\n\nBurn After Reading is a full-stack web application I built to solve a real gap: people needed a way to share sensitive files and have real-time private conversations without leaving a permanent digital footprint.\n\nFiles are encrypted before they hit the server. Each file can be configured to self-destruct after a time limit or a set number of views. The Burn Chat feature provides end-to-end encrypted real-time messaging that automatically disappears — powered by ECDH key exchange and AES-GCM, so the server never holds readable content.\n\nThe architecture is built on zero-knowledge principles: even I can't read what users share. OTP verification, webhook support, brute-force protection, and secure session handling are all baked in from day one — not bolted on as an afterthought.",
